# Controls how files' line-endings are checked in and out of this repo:
# - Every text file is checked out with LF line endings in the working directory (eol=lf)
# - Every potentially introduced CRLF in a text file will be converted back to LF on staging (* text=auto)
# Write-up: https://github.com/juliusgb/til/blob/main/git/git-repo-gitattributes.md
* text=auto eol=lf

# Force bash scripts to always use LF line endings so that if a repo is accessed
# in Unix via a file share from Windows, the scripts will work.
*.sh text eol=lf

# Force batch scripts to always use CRLF line endings so that if a repo is accessed
# in Windows via a file share from Linux, the scripts will work.
*.{cmd,[cC][mM][dD]} text eol=crlf
